% dopOSCCI wish-list From Hannah Keage 16-Dec-2013
% 
% a.       Average mean velocity increase during LI 2-sec period.
% 
% b.      Maximal average velocity increase within POI (this is not
% necessarily related to LI period).
% 
% c.       An ability to change the LI period (i.e. toggle it across).  I
% know this sounds terribly unsystematic, however, sometimes I find the LI
% period hangs on at the start of the end of the POI, especially when there
% is not much difference between the hemispheres, trying to get some sort
% of LI difference.  In some cases, I don?t think that is a meaningful
% difference, when you look at the waveform.  I am coming at this from an
% ERP-perspective, but if you have an ERP component time-window, sometimes
% you will be flexible when looking at an individual case if the window
% does not accurately reflect their waveform.
